## Performance Measures

#### Accuracy
Accuracy is generally not the preferred performance measure for classifiers, especially when you are dealing with skewed datasets (i.e., when some
classes are much more frequent than others).

#### Confusion Matrix
A much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the confusion matrix. The general idea is to count the number of times instances of class A are classified as class B.

#### Precision and Recall

## Matrix

$$A_{m,n} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
 \end{pmatrix}$$
